* Workflow
- Raw Data -> Features -> Model -> Test
** First step: Get the raw data, know about it, two data sets: Timit and SBC
  - Mixing of the speech of two speakers from the TIMID data.
  - This process would involve Cleaning it first: Remove noise, essentially
    VAD
** NExt step: Find the features
  - We have many features, like MFCC, MEl spectrum et al
  - Decide which to use
  - Use VAD to filter out only the frames which match
** Training
  - Construct a model, based out of neural nets, on keras
  - train it with training data
** Testing phase
  - Send the data to this stuff, from the files
* Req
- Keras(Theano based)
- HTK
- Equal error rate
